# QuickySitter — Changelog

Customer-facing changes only. Each entry is tagged **Fix** (bug fix) or
**Feature** (new). Routine internal/technical changes are not listed.
Grouped by version, newest on top.

## Version 1.03
- **Fix** — The first sit after the furniture had been idle a while now plays the proper animation right away (in rare cases it could show the default pose until you re-sat)

## Version 1.02
- **Fix** — [QS]select dialog throttle
- **Fix** — [DUMP] no longer freezes when a plugin stops responding; it skips the unresponsive plugin, finishes the dump, and posts a notice naming it
- **Fix** — [DUMP] no longer fails with "too many HTTP requests" on large configs — the output is paced to stay under Second Life's rate limit, so the settings link comes out complete (and warns instead of silently truncating if a limit is ever hit)
